### STEPS
Aim is to deploy the Test Machines on AWS through terraform. 


>**IMPORTANT**: We will first run our Bastion terraform plan and then run terraform plan for application server.  



## <ins>**Bastion Server**:</ins>
Navigate to the Cloud9 terminal and copy **bastion.tf**, **bastion_install.tpl** file from the Resources folder to the Development folder.

```console
  cp ./Resources/bastion.tf ./Development/bastion.tf
  cp ./Resources/bastion_install.tpl ./Development/bastion_install.tpl
  cd ./Development
``` 

Run the following set of commands.

1. **<ins>terraform init</ins>**

```console
terraform init
``` 
This will download & install all the necessary modules.

1. **<ins>terraform validate**</ins>

```console
terraform validate
```
This will check for any syntax error in the code.

3. **<ins>terraform plan**</ins>

To understand what the code will reflect and do on your AWS account run 

```console
terraform plan --out awslab
```
The resources shown with the '+' symbol are set to be created. It will show the number of additional resources to be added.

4. **<ins>terrafrom apply**</ins>

If you are satisfied with the plan of the configuration apply it. 

```console
terraform apply awslab
```

Open the AWS console to see bastion server in the EC2 Instance.

Bastion:

Wait for the bastion server to be up and ready before running the following commands.

## <ins>**Application Server**:</ins>
Navigate to the Cloud9 terminal and copy **apps.tf**, **apache_install.tpl** files from the Resources folder to the Development folder.

```console
  cp ./Resources/apps.tf ./Development/apps.tf
  cp ./Resources/apache_install.tpl ./Development/apache_install.tpl
  cd ./Development
``` 

Run the following set of commands.

1. **<ins>terraform init</ins>**

```console
terraform init
``` 
This will download & install all the necessary modules.

```console

```
The resources shown with the '+' symbol are set to be created. It will show the number of additional resources to be added.

4. **<ins>terrafrom apply**</ins>

If you are satisfied with the plan of the configuration apply it. 

```console
terraform apply awslab
```

After the deployment go to the AWS Console and check the instance is AWS Console for your application machine(EC2-ubuntu here) and bastion server.

You can further expand the machine to see details specific to it.
