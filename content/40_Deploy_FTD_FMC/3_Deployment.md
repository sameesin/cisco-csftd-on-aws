### STEPS
Aim is to deploy Cisco Secure FTDv and FMCv instances on AWS through Terraform. 

Navigate to the Cloud9 terminal and copy **instances.tf** file from the Resources folder to the Development folder. Then navigate to the Development folder

```console
  cp ./Resources/instances.tf ./Development/instances.tf
  cd ./Development
``` 

>Note: We will deploy ```2``` FTDs and ```1``` FMC instances

And then run the following set of commands.

1. **<ins>terraform init</ins>**

   ```console 
   terraform init
   ``` 
   This will download & install all the necessary modules.

2. **<ins>terraform validate**</ins>

    ```console
    terraform validate
    ``` 
    to check for any syntax error in the code.

3. **<ins>terraform plan**</ins>

    To understand what the code will reflect and do on your AWS account run 
    ```console
    terraform plan --out awslab
    ```
    The resources shown with the '+' symbol are set to be created. It will show the additional number of resources to be added by Terraform.

4. **<ins>terraform apply**</ins>

    If you are satisfied with the plan of the configuration, run 
    ```console
    terraform apply awslab
    ```

Open your AWS Management Console to see if all the resources are correctly deployed.
