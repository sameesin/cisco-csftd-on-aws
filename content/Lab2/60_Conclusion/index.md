You’ve successfully finished the second lab of the Cisco Secure Firewall on AWS workshop!

In this workshop, you’ve learned how to use terraform to:

1. Use Terraform to deploy and configure Cisco FTDv in your AWS environment
2. Deploy and configure an AWS Gateway load balancer to distribute traffic to FTDv
3. Deploy test EC2 instances to test traffic
4. Test traffic from the test machines through Cisco FTDv firewalls behind an AWS Gateway Load Balancer
