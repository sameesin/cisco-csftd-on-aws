### STEPS
Aim is to deploy the Load balancer on AWS through terraform. 

Navigate to the Cloud9 terminal and copy **loadbalancers.tf** file from the Resources folder to the Development folder.

```console
  cp ./Resources/loadbalancers.tf ./Development/loadbalancers.tf
  cd ./Development
``` 

And then run the following set of commands.

1. **<ins>terraform init</ins>**

```conslole
terraform init
``` 
Running this will download & install all the necessary modules.

2. **<ins>terraform validate**</ins>

```console
terraform validate
``` 
Run this to check for any syntax error in the code.

3. **<ins>terraform plan**</ins>

To understand what the code will reflect and do on your AWS account run 
```console
terraform plan --out awslab
```
The resources shown with the '+' symbol are set to be created. It will show the number of additional resources to be added.

```
