## Congratulations!
You’ve successfully finished the first lab of the Cisco Secure Firewall on AWS workshop!

In this workshop, you’ve learned how to use terraform to:

1. Use Terraform to deploy and configure Cisco FTDv and FMCv in your AWS environment
2. Deploy and configure an AWS network load balancer to distribute traffic to FTDv
3. Deploy test EC2 instances to test traffic
4. Test traffic to the test machines through Cisco FTDv firewalls behind an AWS Network Load Balancer
